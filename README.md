- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GiorgiusAurelius
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer science, volleyball and running. Yeah, I know, weird stuff to say here.
- ðŸ˜„ Even though I'm close to graduate from a sofware engineering master, I'm not so confident in my coding skills. Therefre, I decided to open this account to explore some of my interests. Right, now I'm familiarizing with Unix and I plan on embarking on some cool projects. 
- ðŸ“« If you have any questions or you want to contact me for whatever reason, open an issue to one of my future projects or just email me at: dmgiorgius@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: Still have to figure this out ^^'
